# runnershigh
Having an exercise routine is a factor in healthy living — I produced Runners’ High to capture the high of endorphins that enthusiast athletes can experience. The outcome of this project is my education of basic and advanced web development technologies, with early design and development guidance from tutors at University of Huddersfield.
